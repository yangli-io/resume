# Yang Li - Resume
This is my resume, I really like github's markdown capabilities so I decided to put my resume up here.

## Introduction
I am a big fan of Javascript and have dedicated my career to the mastery of it. Functional programming is my favourite way to program. I have worked heavily on Angular, React and Node.js projects and nowadays I dedicate most of my time in React.js, Node.js and React Native. I do enjoy a bit of other languages from time to time but my main Focus is Javascript. So if you're looking to hire me, it should be because you have a strong Javascript focus or you want to upgrade your Javascript skill pool.

Most people tend to associate Javascript developers with frontend work only but that's all changing. In my case, I have a diverse full stack experience ranging

* Creating customized frameworks to cater for different requirements
* Leading a microservices architecture using Node.js (About 50 different microservices in a year)
* Reusability Focused; sharing code with NPM, creating npm templates, microservice templates and etc.
* Migration to Javascript, Frontend and Server-side
* Extensive DevOps capabilities, AWS, Openshift, Docker.
* Setup Continuous Integration (Lint, Unit tests, security checks, E2E Tests) and Continuous Deployment

When it comes to industries, I don't have a strong preference as you can see from my experience. I am much more intrigued at the technologies involved. I am interested in companies that are looking to invest heavily on the Javascript Stack and recently also interested in Machine Learning projects.
