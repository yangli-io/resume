# Yang Li - Resume

## Introduction
I am a tech lead with a diverse range of experience. I have specialised myself with the Javascript language both UI and backend. I have strong understanding and experience of a wide range of technology, from UI to Backend and Database. Aside from technology, I am a natural leader who is extremely outspoken.
