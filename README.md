# Yang Li - Resume
This is my resume, I really like github's markdown capabilities so I decided to put my resume up here.

## Background
I am a late bloomer in technology and most of my knowledge of programming are either from electives during university or self pursued online courses.  I studied finance in university and started programming with Microsoft Excel. I made a lot of useful spreadsheets, some of which are still being used to this date.  As much as my role (project manager) tried to keep me away from programming, I couldn't stop myself automating just about everything.  Excel becaming extremely limiting for me when I wanted to build something cloud based, so I turned to the web and taught myself the web.  My first app was extremely ambitious, it used php, html, css, javascript and tried to create an online project management system.  Before I could complete the app, I was put into an actual Web Development role.
